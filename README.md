How do I approach designing software?
What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
What design process did you follow for your project work?
How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

Working on this project has help me develop new design approaches and skills to better set up and complete my projects. I feel that I have especially improved on organizing my methods and applying proper coding structure to ensure my code is easily readable and easy to adjust. I feel that I have also learned more about planning my projects and constantly testing to ensure efficency and accuracy. 

How do I approach developing programs?
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
How did iteration factor into your development?
How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

I learned several new development strategies while working on this final. I feel that the most significant aspect I was able to grasp was to properly set up my rendering pipeline for my objects and establsh a uniformed and properly implemented shader. Working throughout the several milestones throughout this course allowed me to try several different approaches to implementation until I was able to discover the most efficent process for rendering my objects. 

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

I feel that computer science can help me reach my goals for several reasons. Computer science is incredibly broad and covers several foundational aspects to support me in becoming an efficent software developer. I feel that learning more about computational graphics and visualizations will go a long way in assiting my career and educational pathway by giving me more tools and skills to implement in my projects especially from a design aspect.
